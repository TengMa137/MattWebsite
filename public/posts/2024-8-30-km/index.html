<p>Hunarian algorithm or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is well known for solving assignment problem, which involves assigning tasks to agents (or jobs to workers) such that the total cost is minimized (or the total profit is maximized), subject to the constraint that each agent is assigned exactly one task, and each task is assigned to exactly one agent.</p>

<p>We are given an $n \times n$ cost matrix $C$, where $c_{ij}$ is the cost of assigning agent $i$ to task $j$. <br>
<div class="math">

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{min} & \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} c_{ij}x_{ij} \\
s.t. & \sum_{j \in J}x_{ij} = 1 \text{ for all } i \in I \\
&\sum_{i \in I}x_{ij} = 1 \text{ for all } j \in J \\
& x_{ij} \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

</div>
</p>
<p>Note that $x_{ij} = 1$ if i is assigned to j and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Assignment Problem is a classic linear programming problem, since both the objective function and constraints are linear sums, even though it involves binary decision variables. We can model the problem as a bipartite graph and interpret the algorithm from the perspective of graph (find the perfect matching by finding augmenting path), but this blog will not cover this topic. Let&rsquo;s try to understand Hungarian algorithm under the framework of linear programming. Since the primal problem is tricky to deal with, let&rsquo;s go for the dual form of the problem.</p>
<details><summary>Primal to Dual</summary>
<p>To convert the primal Assignment Problem to its dual form, we need to use Lagrange multipliers to relax the equality constraints in the primal problem.
Introduce $u_i$ as the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint that agent $i$ is assigned exactly one task ($\sum_j x_{ij} = 1$),  $v_j$ as the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint that task $j$ is assigned to exactly one agent ($\sum_i x_{ij} = 1$), then formulate the Lagrangian:</p>
<div class="math">

$$
L(x_{ij},u_i,v_j)=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij}x_{ij}+\sum_{i=1}^n u_i (1-\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij})+\sum_{j=1}^n v_j (1-\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij})
$$

</div>

<p>Lagrange dual function is defined as the minimum value of the Lagrangian over primal variables:</p>
<div class="math">

$$
g(u,v)=\text{inf}_x L(x,u,v)
$$

</div>

<p>where $\inf_{x}$ means the infimum (the lower bound) of the Lagrangian over $x$. <br>
Since the dual function is the pointwise infimum of a family of affine functions of (u, v), it is concave, even when the problem is not convex [2].
To minimize this Lagrangian $L(x_{ij},u_i,v_j)$ with respect to $x_{ij}$, rewrite the Lagrangian as:</p>
<div class="math">

$$
L(x_{ij},u_i,v_j)=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n [(c_{ij}-u_i-v_j)x_{ij}] + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i + \sum_{j=1}^n v_j
$$

</div>

<p>The minimization occurs in the condition:<br>
<div class="math">

$$
x_{ij}=1 \ \text{  if  }\  c_{ij} \leq u_i+v_j \\
x_{ij}=0 \ \text{  if  }\  c_{ij} > u_i+v_j
$$ 

</div>
</p>
<p>Now we want to find the tightest lower bound or minimum duality gap, so we need to maximize the dual function w.r.t $u$ and $v$. In the case of $x_{ij}=1$ If $c_{ij} \leq u_i+v_j$, the maximum occurs when $c_{ij} = u_i+v_j$, so $c_{ij}-u_i-v_j$ in Lagrangian is non-negative.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="dual-form-of-the-assignment-problem">
  Dual Form of the Assignment Problem
  <a class="heading-link" href="#dual-form-of-the-assignment-problem">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The dual form of the Assignment Problem can be written as:<br>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{max} &amp;\sum_{i=1}^n u_i + \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \
s.t. &amp; u_i+v_j \leq c_{ij}, \ \forall i, j
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where $u_i$ is the dual variable associated with agent $i$&rsquo;s assignment constraint, $v_j$ is the dual variable associated with task $j$&rsquo;s assignment constraint.<br>
The strong duality theorem of linear programming guarantees that if a feasible and bounded solution exists for the primal linear problem, the dual linear problem is feasible (and bounded as well, by weak duality), with the same optimum value as the primal [3]. The primal problem has constraints that ensure every agent is assigned exactly one task, and every task is assigned exactly one agent, a feasible primal solution exists (since the problem is well-posed with the same number of agents and tasks).</p>

<p>Given a $n \times n$ cost matrix (Adjacent Matrix in Graph theory) $C$, the algorithm is summarized as 5 steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find and subtract the row minimum, namely find the minimum element in each row of the cost matrix and subtract the minimum element in each row from the element in that row.</li>
<li>Find and subtract the colume minimum, namely find the minimum element of each column in the remaining matrix and subtract the minimum element in each column from the elements in that column.</li>
<li>Use the minimum number of horizontal or vertical lines to cover all zero elements in the matrix. If the minimum number of lines is equal to $n$, stop running; if the minimum number of lines is less than $n$, continue to the next step.</li>
<li>Find the minimum value among the uncovered elements, subtract this minimum value from the uncovered elements, and add this minimum value to the elements at the intersection of different lines.</li>
<li>Go back to step 3, that is, continue to cover all zero elements in the matrix with the minimum number of horizontal or vertical lines. If the minimum number of lines is equal to $n$, stop running; if the minimum number of lines is less than $n$, execute step 4. <br></li>
</ol>
<p>For details of $O(n^3)$ algorithm implementation, refer to this blog from <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/hungarian-algorithm.html#the-mathcalon4-algorithm"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cp algorithms</a>, where the dual variables $u,v$ are denoted as potential. Hungarian algorithm updates the search of optimal value by continuesly increase the sum of $u,v$:
$$
f= \sum_{i=1}^n u[i] + \sum_{j=1}^n v[j]
$$</p>
<p>In the context of MOT, cost matrix is filled with IOU or similarity score obtained from ReID features between objects in two consecutive frames. Sometimes the matrix is non-square, we can add dummy rows or columes with zeros and run more iterations.</p>
