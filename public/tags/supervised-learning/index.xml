      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and solve complex problems. These neural networks are capable of learning hierarchical representations of data, enabling them to extract features and patterns from raw input data. Deep learning has been used in a wide range of applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. This blog covers the basics of four different types of DL models, paves the way to further in-depth study of various DNN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mitchell: &amp;ldquo;A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E&amp;rdquo;. Regarding of what learning is,Herbert A. Simon once defined it as &amp;ldquo;the ability that a system improves the performance of itself by executing some process&amp;rdquo;. Machine learning is a data driven subject that applies machine learning models to data analyzation and prediction. Generally machine learning can be categorized into: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning. To design a machine learning system, basically we need to do the following tasks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
