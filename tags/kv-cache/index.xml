      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling significant advancements in tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not without limitations. One of the most significant challenges facing LLMs today is the problem of inference speed. Due to the sheer size and complexity of these models, the process of making predictions or extracting information from them can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Several ways to speed up the LLMs without updating hardware: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
