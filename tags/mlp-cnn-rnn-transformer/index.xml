      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and solve complex problems. These neural networks are capable of learning hierarchical representations of data, enabling them to extract features and patterns from raw input data. Deep learning has been used in a wide range of applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. This blog covers the basics of four different types of DL models, paves the way to further in-depth study of various DNN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
